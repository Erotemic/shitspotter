The ``shitspotter`` module is where I will start public work on the
"shitspotter" algorithm. The data will be made public as soon as I figure out a
hosting situation. Likely this will be done via IPFS.

For now this is mostly a placeholder module where I will put scripts that will
help me ingest the data into the kwcoco format, which will be suitable for
learning on a soon-to-exist module (maybe kwai, kwlearn, kwdetect, something
like that).

For context, I'll write a bit about what this project is and what my plans are.
First, let me start with the modivation.

In Fall 2019, I was at the local dog park, and I found myself in a situation
where my dog pooped, but I had forgotten to bring bags with me. I walked to the
local bag station (thank you DGS), grabed one, but then I couldn't find where
the poop was. The brown fallen leaves made it very difficult to find the poop.

This happened every so often. Often I would be able to find it, but I'm afraid
sometimes, I was unable to relocate the "object of interest". This got me
thinking, what if I had a phone app that could scan the area with the camera
and try to locate the poop? If I had a dataset, training a poop detection model
with today's deep learning methods should work pretty well.

Thus, on 2020-12-18, I took my first picture. My dog pooped, I took a picture,
I picked it up, and then I took an "after" picture. The idea is that I will
align the pictures (probably via computing local features like sift or some
deep variant and then estimating an affine/projective transform) and then take
a difference image. That should let me seed some sort of semi-automated
annotation process.

Then in 2021-05-11, one of my co-workers suggested that I take a 3rd unrelated
picture to use as negative examples, so I took that suggestion and started
doing that.


As of 2021-11-11 I've collected 1935 pictures with "798" before/after/(maybe
negative) groups of images.

I started writing scripts to get all of the data ingested. 
For now I'll post this teaser analytic:



.. The large version wont work because github strips rst image rescaling.

Check back for updates, but because this is a personal project, it might take
some time for it to fully drop.
