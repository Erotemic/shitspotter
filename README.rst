The ``shitspotter`` module is where I've started public work on the
"shitspotter" algorithm. The data will be made public as soon as I figure out a
hosting situation (likely IPFS).

I will incrementally populate this module with scripts that will
help me ingest the data into the kwcoco format, which will be suitable for
learning.

Check back for updates, but because this is a personal project, it might take
some time for it to fully drop.

Updates
=======

* 2021-11-23 - Added annotation process overview and dataset sample.
* 2021-11-11 - Initial upload of data munging scripts.
* 2020-12-18 - Took the first picture.


Modivation
==========

In Fall 2019, I was at the local dog park, and I found myself in a situation
where my dog pooped, but I had forgotten to bring bags with me. I walked to the
local bag station (thank you DGS), grabed one, but then I couldn't find where
the poop was. The brown fallen leaves made it very difficult to find the poop.

This happened every so often. Often I would be able to find it, but I'm afraid
sometimes, I was unable to relocate the "object of interest". This got me
thinking, what if I had a phone app that could scan the area with the camera
and try to locate the poop? If I had a dataset, training a poop detection model
with today's deep learning methods should work pretty well.

Thus, on 2020-12-18, I took my first picture. My dog pooped, I took a picture,
I picked it up, and then I took an "after" picture. The idea is that I will
align the pictures (probably via computing local features like sift or some
deep variant and then estimating an affine/projective transform) and then take
a difference image. That should let me seed some sort of semi-automated
annotation process.

Then in 2021-05-11, one of my co-workers suggested that I take a 3rd unrelated
picture to use as negative examples, so I took that suggestion and started
doing that.

Dataset Status
==============

As of 2021-11-11 I've collected 1935 pictures with "798" before/after/(maybe
negative) groups of images.

I started writing scripts to get all of the data ingested. 
For now I'll post this teaser scatterplot:

Dataset Sample
==============

The following images illustrates a sample of 9 images from the dataset. Each of these images has poop in it. In some cases it's easy to spot. In other cases, it can be quite difficult.

The dataset contains a wide variety of image and background conditions that occur in update New York, including: seasonal changes, snow, rain, daytime, nighttime (some taken with flash, others taken with my phone's *night mode*), grass, concrete, etc...  


Annotation Process
==================

To make annotation easier, I've taken before a picture before and after I clean up the poop. 
The idea is that I can align these images and use image-differencing to more quickly find the objects of interest in the image.
As you can see, it's not so easy to spot the shit, especially when there are leaves in the image.

But with a little patience and image processing, it's not to hard to narrow down the search.

Scripts to produce these visualizations have been checked into the repo.
