# Reviews

This subdirectory contains reviews and rebuttals for my attempts to publish
this paper.

The reviews / rebuttals here are for NeurIPS if not otherwise stated. The WACV
reviews are marked. Some of the content might be in draft form, I didn't do
much curation, but I wanted to tie this part of the peer review process to this
repo as I continue this experiment in on-the-side research & publishing. I
might try to organize this better in the future.


As of 2025-11-15 I've submitted it to NeurIPS 2026 and WACV 2026, both of which
it was rejected from. The NeurIPS reviews were helpful and led to an improved
quality of the paper. After the rebuttal the reviews were generally favorable,
although it ultimately didn't make the cut. This is understandable.

For WACV, I submitted the revised NeurIPS paper after reformatting.
Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to rework the intro to really focus on
the application, and I think that was an issue, but I also just didn't have the
bandwidth to do it, the formatting into 2 column paper took too much time, and
I was happy with the NeurIPS version. I thought it had a good shot at getting
in, but I lost the reviewer lottery with an overall negative reception. I think
the reviewers missed the point and failed to understand details that were
communicated directly in the paper. 

I did not resubmit to CVPR, instead I'm going to try to submit this to a WACV
workshop on wastevision.

They seem concerned about waste management, illegal dumping, and environmental
pollution, so its a bit of a stretch, but I think still within scope.

What's more frustrating is that I have an expanded test dataset ready, but I'm
not going to be able to revise the paper to include it in time. I give up my
weekends to work on this, and I can only do so much without burning out.

Kinda wish I had collaborators to share the workload, but at the same time I
can't expect too much when I'm asking for people to donate their time. I'm so
grateful to people like Sam W. - who contributed the first test imaages, Mikael
S - who contributed a large part of the test dataset, and @mkorzunowicz on
github - who developed a proof-of-concept phone app, and Arshia I - who pointed
me at the roboflow dataset. This is in addition to the other people who via
github and emails have shown interest in the project. These people helped me
push the project farther than I could have otherwise.
