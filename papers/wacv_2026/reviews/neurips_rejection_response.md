Summary:

Our paper was rejected, though reviews were generally positive and improved after the rebuttal. This project—an experiment in open science—produced a novel dataset and stronger benchmarks through reviewer feedback. While not accepted at this tier-1 venue, we remain proud of the work, have made it openly available, and hope it sparks further progress and discussion.

While we are disappointed by the rejection, it wasn't unexpected.  The reviews were generally positive.  This validates the value of the work, but in such a competitive tier 1 venue, it is understandable that it did not make the cut.

This project was also an experiment in open science - asking what impact a small, unfunded research effort can make in spare time.  The GitHub repository openly documents the project's evolution and contains details beyond the paper itself.  Even without having a peer reviewed publication, the work is starting to generate interest.  This shows that even modest contributions, when shared openly, can resonate and lay groundwork for future progress.

At the same time, peer review - an imperfect process - showed notable value here.  The feedback pushed us towards rigorous investigation of foundational and mobile models, and ultimately towards our goal of enabling poop-aware AI applications.  This resulted in a significantly strengthened paper and a notable result: GroundingDino-v2 struggles with zero-shot poop detection, but with our dataset it can be tuned to perform much better.  An open question now is how best to distill this into an efficient, mobile-ready model for deployment that can be used to find hidden poop in the environment.  Solving this will allow us to release our application.

We hope this small anecdotal evidence serves to strengthen public trust in the peer review process and also work to demystify it. Peer review is not a one-and-done, it is iterative.

The only point we wish to raise is that we feel our investigation into decentralized dataset distribution was underappreciated.  Perhaps that will change with time.  Peer discovery does seem to be improving in the trackerless peer-to-peer hosting ecosystem, so that will motivate a reproduction, and refinement, of our download time study with new software versions.

We will seek to publish this work in other venues, but even if that does not happen, we remain proud of what we have accomplished and are happy that it and these reviews are openly available.  Again, we thank the reviewers for their thoughtful engagement, which strengthened the work and improved its rigor.
