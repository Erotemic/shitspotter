These are notes I took when discussing how to revise the paper for NeurIPS with
Anthony.

* Dataset paper - need to compare to datasets in the intro / abstract - work in key stats. 

Why is it unique interesting and different (in the intro).

Point out interesting aspects in the dataset in the abstract and intro.

Table - columns properties of datasets.

Criteria for object detection and segmentation.

Move up the related work section.

Find another focused object detection dataset.

Percent on average targets occupy.

Define a few tasks (specifically in the dataset section): 

    * Basic detection

    * Basic segmentation


Very early show a close up image zoomed in on poop with the annotation.


Make it more clear that there are many dogs.


Make point about flash vs night? 


Remove figure 6?


Mitigate small objects vs big bias by re-weighting?


Results by different times of day / year.
