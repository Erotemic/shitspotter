%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}

    This work chronicles one researcher's un-funded journey to build a phone
    application that can detect dog poop in images, and make the data widely
    available as a benchmark dataset.


\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


Poop detection is a simple problem, suitable for exploring the capabilities of
object detection models while also containing non-trivial challenges.

There are several challenges in detecting dog poop in phone-camera images.
* Resolution
* Distractors
* Occlusion
* Variation in appearance (old/new/healthy/sick)


Hosting a dataset challenges intended for scientific use
* Requires an institution willing to host or payment for a hosting service
* Prone to outages (give VGG outage as example)
* Requires updates (makes bittorrent difficult)

\subsection{Dataset Construction}

Labelme for annotations with segment anything

\subsection{Dataset Distribution}

Discuss distributing the dataset via IPFS versus centralized distribution
systems.

\subsection{Experiments}

Measure the performance of our algorithm versus a baseline.

\subsection{Conclusion}

IPFS is a promising solution for hosting scientific datasets, but does have pain points.

Our dataset is sufficient to train an object detection network to (level of
precision/recall).
